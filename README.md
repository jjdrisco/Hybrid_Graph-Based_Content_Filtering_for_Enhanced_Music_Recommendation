# Hybrid Graph-Based Content Filtering for Enhanced Music Recommendation

*By: Sarah Borsotto, John Driscoll, Taylor Martinez, and Thuy Nguyen*

Abstract:

The abundance of music available today necessitates effective personalized recommendation systems to guide listeners through extensive catalogs. However, traditional systems often create "filter bubbles," which limit diversity and exploration. We present HyG-Con, a hybrid recommendation model that integrates knowledge graph-based genre transitions with clustering techniques to enhance cross-genre discovery. Our evaluation demonstrates that HyG-Con surpasses baseline content-based and stochastic models by delivering exploratory yet coherent playlists, facilitating smooth transitions between genres while maintaining relevance. Although HyG-Con improves diversity, user feedback indicates a tradeoff between diversity and feature variance, highlighting the need for a careful balance in playlist design. This work shows promise in breaking filter bubbles and enriching the music discovery experience.
